## You can

* [x] Register user
* [x] Send messages to other users
* [x] Get messages from many users at once
* [x] Get history of messages (Everyone have their own session)
* [x] Send messages to user even if he is offline
* [x] Catch up with messages after login

`gRPC terminal chat` is the only tool that you need for **human interacions**.

## Technology stack

* **Python gRPC** powers client-server calls
* **Google protocolbuffers** Unified declaration of messages and code generation
* **ETCD** highly avaible and fast storage

## Requirements

* **ETCD** v2.3.7
* **Python** 3.8+

* **grpcio-tools** 1.51.1
* **python libs** defined in requirements.txt files

## Installation

> **Warning**
> Writing to your friends about your secrets and wet dreams could be foolish, Security wasn't addressed yet. :triangular_flag_on_post:

### Get source

```sh
git clone https://github.com/Gregb122/grpc-terminal-chat.git
```

### How generate python protobuf files for server and client

Install grpc-tools to generate code from proto files

```sh
pip install grpcio-tools
```

and then in a root directory of the project:

```sh
python3 -m grpc_tools.protoc -I protobufs --python_out=. --pyi_out=. --grpc_python_out=. protobufs/common/*.proto
```

## Server deployment

### (Optional) How to create virual python env

You should put valid path to python interpreter(1st arg)

```sh
cd grpc-terminal-chat
virtualenv -p /usr/bin/python3.8 python_3.8_virtualenv
```

then ctivate:

```sh
source python_3.8_virtualenv/bin/activate
```

### How to run serwer localy

Run etcd2, you can do this with docker:

```sh
docker run --name etcd2 -d -p 2379:2379 -p 2380:2380 -p 4001:4001 -p 7001:7001 -v ~/temp/data0/etcd:/data wolfdeng/etcd2-docker
```

And to check if ETCD instance is running:

```sh
etcdctl --endpoints=http://<ip_of_etcd:2379> ls

```

install required python libs from requirements.txt:

```sh
pip install -r chat_server/requirements.txt
```

**run server:**

Set ip address of your ETCD server as env variable:

```sh
export ETCD_SERVER_IP_ADDR=<etcd server ip>
```

```sh
python3 -m chat_server.src.main
```

### Docker compose

```sh
docker-compose -f "docker_compose.yml" up
```

## Client usage

### How to run client

Install required python libs from requirements.txt:

```sh
pip install -r chat_client/requirements.txt
```

To start the interactive program with default args, simply run:

```sh
python3 -m chat_client.src.main
```

`grpc-terminal-chat` was built with terminal in mind. You often can quit current scope by typing **/q**. Remember to register before login.

## Development

### Tox

```sh
pip install tox
```

Run tests and code coverage

```sh
tox -e py
```

You can generate html file from coverage raport

```sh
coverage html -i
```

### SonarQube

You can use SonarQube, to install follow official docs:
> <https://docs.sonarqube.org/latest/>

Set project-key to:
> grpc-terminal-chat

After project creation set up env variables

```sh
export SONAR_RUN_HOST_URL=<server url:port>
export SONAR_RUN_LOGIN=<server token>
```

Then, just run:

```sh
sonar-scanner
```
